# 📝 Task Manager Application

## 📌 Overview

Task Manager is a **microservices-based application** that allows users to manage their daily tasks with secure authentication.
The backend is built with **Spring Boot microservices**, while the frontend is built with **Vue.js (Quasar Framework)**.

This repository contains:

* **Backend source code** (`/backend`) + **pre-built JAR files** (`/release-backend`)
* **Frontend source code** (`/frontend`) + **pre-built SPA build** (`/release-frontend`)

👉 You can either run from **source** (for developers) or directly use the **release folders** (for supervisors/testers).

## 🏗️ Microservices Architecture

### 🔹 1. Eureka Server (Port: `9092`)

* Service registry where all microservices register.
* Provides centralized discovery and monitoring.

### 🔹 2. Auth Service (Port: `9090`)

* Handles user registration, login, and **JWT-based authentication**.
* Provides **profile management** (update username & password).

### 🔹 3. Task Service (Port: `9094`)

* Manages CRUD operations for tasks:

  * ✅ Create tasks with deadlines
  * ✏️ Update tasks
  * ⏳ Mark tasks as Pending / Completed
  * ❌ Delete tasks

### 🔹 4. Gateway Service (Port: `9093`)

* Acts as a **single entry point** for frontend & backend requests.
* Routes API calls to Auth Service & Task Service.

## 🎨 Frontend (Vue + Quasar SPA)

The frontend is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** already built and included in this repo under `/release-frontend`.

### Pages Included:

* 🔑 **Login Page** → User login via JWT
* 🆕 **Register Page** → New user signup
* 📊 **Dashboard** → Displays all tasks (Pending / Completed)
* ➕ **Add Task Page** → Create new tasks with due dates
* ✏️ **Edit Task Page** → Update tasks or mark as completed
* 👤 **Profile Management** → Update username & password securely

## ⚙️ Setup Manual

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

* Install **Java 17+**
* Install **Node.js (with npm)**

---

### 2️⃣ Run Backend (Spring Boot Microservices)

You have **two options**:

#### 👉 Option A – Run from Release JARs (easiest)

Use the JARs included in `/release-backend`:

```sh
# Step 1 – Start Eureka Server
cd release-backend
java -jar eureka-server.jar

# Step 2 – Start Auth Service
java -jar auth-service.jar

# Step 3 – Start Task Service
java -jar task-service.jar

# Step 4 – Start Gateway Service
java -jar gateway-service.jar
```

* 📌 Eureka Dashboard → [http://localhost:9092](http://localhost:9092)
* 📌 Gateway (entry point) → [http://localhost:9093](http://localhost:9093)

#### 👉 Option B – Run from Source Code

If you want to build manually:

```sh
cd backend/eureka-server
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/eureka-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

cd backend/auth-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/auth-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

cd backend/task-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/task-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

cd backend/gateway-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/gateway-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run Frontend

You also have **two options**:

#### 👉 Option A – Run from Release Build (recommended)

Use the already-built `/release-frontend` folder:

```sh
cd release-frontend
npx serve .
```

📌 Access → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### 👉 Option B – Run from Source Code

If you want to modify the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
quasar dev
```

---

## ✅ Project Flow

1. Start **Eureka Server** (`9092`)
2. Start **Auth Service** (`9090`)
3. Start **Task Service** (`9094`)
4. Start **Gateway Service** (`9093`)
5. Run frontend with `npx serve .` inside `/release-frontend` → open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
